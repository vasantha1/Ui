<h3>Busy Kittehs Very Busy</h3>

<p>A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens are totally dependent on their mother for survival and they do not normally open their eyes until after seven to ten days. 
After about two weeks, kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest. After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow adult teeth.
Domestic kittens are highly social animals and enjoy human companionship.
</p>

<p>Kittens require a high-calorie diet that contains more protein than the diet of adult cats.
Young orphaned kittens require cat milk every two to four hours, and they need physical stimulation to defecate and urinate.
Cat milk replacement is manufactured to feed to young kittens, because cow's milk does not provide all the necessary nutrients.
Human-reared kittens tend to be very affectionate with humans as adults and sometimes more dependent on them than kittens reared by their mothers, but they can also show volatile mood swings and aggression.
